I'm in the dreamhouse and it seems. That bubba. As well as a Bigger Feline is in the house feline or dog i can't remember a bigger animal. It was snowing outside of it had snowed and we were. Me and yoshi were watching the two of them. But there was also something that i was trying to get to it had to be At 8 or 8:30 it was like some photoshoot or something of some sort. I leave the house to go there. In order to take that photoshoot but On my way i had already been late because i had to help My grandma around the house or something as well as yoshi before i left and ordered it. Make sure that the cats and or the animals were taken care of. In this house we had to separate the animals so they weren't fighting all the time but they weren't necessarily cooperating as well. And so we let them have their free reign in different areas of the house because the house was big enough for that. We did not let them upstairs. Totally unless they were supervised because that's where all the electronics were and you not have time. And so i have left and it was dark by the time i left i tried to take a shortcut In order to get To the place that i was going. But then i decided it was already  far too late i was going to get there way too late so i turned around and went home. But ended up back At the dreamhouse. I was trying to call yoshi cuz we were supposed to meet up there but I awoke before.

An addendum to the previous stream. I. See mary and there is another dude. And it seems to be A mixture between chase and joel. And they don't know that we were talking At all and so They just go up and just straight-up ask her If she's free tomorrow. She says yes very excitedly. I feel pangs of Jealousy and a bit of anger. But i allow those to subside because i do not own her. Their thoughts that i might Try to. Tell the guy About us But i feel that's wrong so i don't.

Typically of going above a certain speed. But. It's almost like it won't let me get that speed but at the same time. The road ahead begins to.

Certain specific object our king of the hill kind of maybe. But. You're supposed to. Tag somebody who is not. Near this object. And then you switch sides. Their mary is apart of this. Game yoshi's a part of this game and a few others i think markells also. But it is nighttime. And. This is a effect like this screen will pan over the object it's being. I rode around and then it will. And then it will. Like one side of the screen will be in another room of the other side of train will be in something different and the people can step. From one side screen to the other. At another point in this dream i am. It's it seems like i had gotten. Up from something. Like i had woken up and i needed to get ready. And i will had to leave. And mary was going to take me and this was like and a. Another ending of ours. But then she goes into the room and gets an argument with somebody i think it's yoshi. So. There is an other person in before this i had gone into us. Another one that was in the bathroom and started peeing into a. It seems to be like a fire pit that has just gone out. A couple of. A blaze up just a little bit but no no fire started. And so i go to the bathroom that they here yelling to kind of. Disperse the energy. And. I go back there and say oh i thought i heard something going on but blah. But then somebody like you think we need to check the door and so we open up the door. And this door goes into a hallway. Kind of like an apartment. And we we open it and we fully check it. And. Check and see if there's any like holes or or anyting. Or if anybody not. And then. We closed the door and i accidentally closed it just a little bit on somebody to want to shoulder. Then they come through and we head towards the back of. The space back to the room. And then i wake up.

I'm i finally find the cat in the basement and bring it up and it seems like it's mary's. And i bring it into room and we talked about stuff. And then. Suddenly me i have to use the bathroom or the shower or something. I drop a huge deuce in the toilet. And the cat. Just comes and jumps in the toilet. Play jump jump back out and it tries to like swim around a little bit. Gross like i just literally took a s*** in there. And then i turn on the shower after putting the the cat in there. And. Then they dislike this. Hole in the bottom left corner of the shower. Which i thought was a dream but it actually goes into. Like the middle crevices area that connects to all the rest of the house. And. Slips away and goes into the basement. So then i. Go to find the cat and run into mary and ask her how the cat is with water. How worried i should be and then she shows me that. The cat had clawed her finger. And that the claw was stuck in it. And then i find a cat again. And i bring it upstairs into the bedroom. And i'm about to take it to the shower but then like. There's this weird. Marketing thing that's going on. Where this woman is trying to sell like multi-level marketing stuff but it's like ridiculously heavy stuff. White bears. A rolling backpack but on the inside are like. Too heavy pierre waters or something. And there's another dude there who's helping. The multi-level marketing chicken they're both hispanic.
